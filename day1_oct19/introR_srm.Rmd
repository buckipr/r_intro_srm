## Why R we here?!?

* **R is a (computing) language and an interpreter that turns commands into...**
    - data manipulation, statistical analysis, graphics, & programming 
    - [R Studio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (Integrated Development Environment) 

* **Large Community of Users**
    - free software (in both senses)
    - [**C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **Network** (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - Google / Stack overflow / Jason 
    
* **Make Your Research Accessible**
    - [Dynamic Documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
    - [Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

## Agenda

* Tuesday
    - basic setup & syntax
    - finding help
    - data types & structures
    - working with data 

* Thursday
    - statistical analyses & exporting results
    - plotting & data carpentry
    - programming
    - dynamic documents 

* GitHub: [https://github.com/buckipr/r_intro_srm](https://github.com/buckipr/r_intro_srm)

## Let's get started

Work with a script for a while

# Data Types & Structures


## Data Types

* A few types of data in R

    + \texttt{logical} - \texttt{TRUE} or \texttt{FALSE}
        - \texttt{NA} - missing data 

    + \texttt{character}
        - \texttt{NA\_character\_} - missing data 

    + numeric - \texttt{integer}, \texttt{double}, \texttt{complex}
        - \texttt{NA\_integer\_} & \texttt{NA\_real\_}

    + \texttt{NULL} - empty object (place holder)

## Data Structures

* R has different structures for holding data, which can be 
organized by...

    + how many dimensions does it have?

    + do the types of data need to be the same?
  
## Data Structures

* **Vectors**
  1. 1 dimension
  1. same data type
    + special case: **factor** (predefined categories) 

* **Matrices**
  1. rows and columns
  1. same data type 

* **Arrays** 
  1. any number of dimensions
  1. same data type 

  
## Data Structures

* **Data Frames**
  1. rows and columns
  1. different data types 

* **Lists**
  1. 1 dimension
  1. different data types (and structures)
